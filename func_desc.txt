keyDown listeners:

alt-d		duplicate character
alt-q		match braces {([])}
alt-z		zen insert from key word (extend in JSON file)
alt-a		zen wrap selection with tag
alt-w		zen repeat last wrap tag
alt-l		toggle line numbers insert
Tab			find next when selected

 Pta.setTabs:
 		A Listener for Tab (charCode 9) handles three actions.
 		With no selection, a single Tab is inserted into the line.
 		With an entire line selected, the whole line is tabbed,
 		and with multiple lines selected, all lines are tabbed.
 		With part of a line selected, a forward search is attempted.

 		Another Listener for Shift-Tab handles two actions.
 		With no selection, a single Back-Tab is performed.
 		With an entire line selected, the whole line tabs back,
 		and with multiple lines selected, all lines tab back. 

 		Use the CSS tab-size property to alter the tab length.

 Pta.setIndent:
 		A Listener captures the enter key (charCode 13). 
 		Auto indentation is a default condition with the
 		Pta library. So the default action of the enter key
 		is cancelled and the beginning of the new line will 
 		indent to the indentation of the previous line.

 Pta.setMatching:
 		A Listener for keyDown with Alt-q will attempt to match
 		one of three kinds of grouping syntax: {([])} 
 		The cursor must be placed at the leading or trailing
 		position of the first or last bracket, respectively.
 		A correct match is indicated by a selection of all text
 		from one bracket to the other.

 Pta.setDupChr:
 		A Listener for keyDown with Alt-d will duplicate the
 		character found in the same position of the previous 
 		line. 

 Pta.setLineNbr:
 		A Listener for keyDown Alt-l inserts line numbers into
 		the far left columns. Pressing Alt-l again removes the
 		line numbers.

 Pta.setZen:
 		A Listener for keyDown with Alt-z uses the word near
 		the cursor (or	selected) as a key to lookup an
 		expanded phrase which has been previously defined in a
 		JSON array. If found, the phrase is then inserted into the
 		text in place of the key word. As expected, the JSON array
 		can be edited to customize the user's own keywords
 		and text phrases (commands, functions, tags, macros, ...)

 		A Listener for keyDown with Alt-a prompts the user to enter
 		an html tag name. The selected text is then enclosed with
 		the beginning and ending html tag. If no text was selected
 		the tags are inserted together at the cursor position.
 		Two special cases are:
					 			/* inserts: 	/* selected text */
					 			<! inserts: 	<!-- selected text -->

		A Listener for keyDown with Alt-w repeats the last Alt-a wrap
		with tag operation.

Pta.findr()
		“findr” is a function that does not require initialization, located
 		inside the Pta namespace with three methods:

 			Pta.findr.findText(“textarea id”,”text field”)
 			Pta.findr.replaceOne('TA','S1','R1')
 			Pta.findr.replaceAll('TA','S1','R1')

 		The first argument in its constructor holds the ID of
 		an INPUT field holding the target text. The	next argument is
 		the ID of the INPUT field for the replacement text.

Pta.insClip()
		Use this function to insert text into the textarea at the cursor.

			Pta.insClip(Textarea ID, Text)

Sample of a keyhandler using insClip function:

		document.getElementById("TA").addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
		if (event.keyCode === 13 && event.altKey) {		// break
			event.preventDefault();
			Pta.insClip("TA", "<br>");
			return;
		}
	});

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Pta with one textarea (id=”TA”) would look like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="Pta.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="tags.js"></script>

// onload
<script>
Pta.listeners.initialize("TA");			
document.getElementById("TA").style.tabSize = 2; // optional
</script>
